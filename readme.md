# Welcome to the Code4Lib 2016 Command Line Bootcamp

## Before the workshop

Please [get an account on Nitrous](https://github.com/csheldonhess/c4l16-cli-workshop/blob/master/get_nitrous.md). It's free. It takes a few minutes--not very long, but you don't want to do it on the day of.

## During the workshop

The slides are available [here](http://bit.ly/c4l-cli-slides), and you can follow along with the commands from the slides and their output [here](https://github.com/csheldonhess/c4l16-cli-workshop/blob/master/command_line_basics.txt). 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8T7kuOzOq6wY4T8tqNosE2YhbEPNgFEc585ED8-3Fk/edit?usp=sharing) (Google doc) is the list of questions and answers from the beginning of the workshop.

The three exercises we've prepared are geared toward [archivists](https://github.com/csheldonhess/c4l16-cli-workshop/tree/master/archiving-exercise/instructions.md), [catalogers](https://github.com/csheldonhess/c4l16-cli-workshop/tree/master/cataloging-exercise/instructions.md), and [web developers](https://github.com/csheldonhess/c4l16-cli-workshop/tree/master/webdev-exercise/instructions.md), but each exercise has useful tools for everyone. We hope to leave you time to do more than one. ðŸ˜ƒ 

We welcome you to work through any of the exercises that seem interesting to you!

## Note for people who would like to run this workshop

Nitrous isn't a thing anymore. There's at least one [adapted version of this workshop](https://github.com/prototypepgh/prototype-cli-workshop) using PythonAnywhere instead of Nitrous, if you'd like to see how that changes things. (Short version: the file structure is a little different, and `wget` doesn't work on bit.ly links.)
